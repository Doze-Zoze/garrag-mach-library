				<p><b>Does Foresight work on projectiles or items? </b>Yes! Foresight works on all projectiles and item tosses within a 5.61 meter range. Note, however, Foresight doesn't work properly on specifically the Banana Peel item.</p>
				<p><b>How do Pyra and Mythra differ? </b>Swapping between Pyra and Mythra changes frame data, attack strength/power, and special moves - Mythra's attacks are faster but weaker; Pyra's attacks are slower, stronger, and have more range. Movement-related stats are also different between the two, with Mythra having faster walk speed, run speed, and air speed. Mythra also has higher jump force and fall speed. Pyra is the same height as Mythra.</p>
				<p><b>What tier is Aegis in? </b>Common Consensus of the lab teams for this character is that together, they can be a top tier. Seperately, they'd only be high tier.</p>
				<p><b>Why does Pyra matter? </b>Pyra is important because Mythra lacks the ability to kill consistently. Her only strong kill moves are Fsmash and Lightning Buster, both of which are not strong neutral tools.</p>
				<p><b>Are you intangible when switching between Pyra and Mythra? </b>Yes, you are intangible for a short period of time (frames 6-18).</p>
				<p><b>Is Blazing End (Pyra's Side-Special) > Footstool a thing? </b>Blazing End > Footstool is a techchase setup that cannot be escaped, however it does not true combo into anything else.</p>
